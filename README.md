# Brocade Sources

A collection of product data sources used to see the Brocade.io service.

## Datakick

Files in `\datakick` include an 'index.csv' containing references for approx. 6500 products, including nutrition data.

Images for products are found in folders with the same GTIN identifier as the product. Not every product has images, but those that do will have one or more image, supplied by users of the datakick.org site.

The Datakick data was licensed by Andrew Kane under a Creative Commons Zero license. Images and data supplied by users was assumed to be provided under the same.

The datakick data was retrieved around 2020-03-28, shortly before the datakick.org site was closed down.
